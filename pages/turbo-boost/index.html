            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>This script only works on Linux systems, as it uses bash.</p>
            <p>Copy the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Discusser/discusser.github.io/main/uploads/turbo_boost" target="_blank">
                source code</a> into a new file and mark the file as executable by running <code>chmod +x file_name</code> in your
                terminal.</p>
            <h2>How to use</h2>
            <p>In many cases, CPUs can be "unlocked" for increased performance. This is called frequency boost, or turbo boost.
                What this does is increase the maximum frequency of all cores. For example, my CPU has a base maximum
                frequency of 2.8GHz (2.8 billion hertz), but that can be increased to 3.8GHz by enabling this frequency
                boost.</p>
            <p>I've created a bash script that only enables the frequency boost when certain apps are open. It is
                recommended to run this script on start up, which can be done by running <code>sudo
                    crontab -e</code> (the script needs to be run by a root user) and adding the following entry <code>
                    @reboot path/to/dir/turbo_boost</code>. The apps that should enable frequency boost can be specified
                in a file called <code>accepted_apps</code>. Each app should be on a new line, and the name can be obtained
                by running <code>ps -ec</code> and looking for the app's command name.</p>
            <p>This script runs every 5 seconds. The first thing it does is read the <code>accepted_apps</code> file in
                case anything has changed. Then, it checks if one of the accepted apps is open, if it is, it enables
                frequency boost. If there are no accepted apps open and frequency boost is enabled, frequency boost will
                get turned off.</p>
