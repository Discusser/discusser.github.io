            <h2>Why programming?</h2>
            <p>It can be fun at times but challenging other times. However, the end goal is always satisfying. Seeing the results of the code
                I wrote is what motivates me.</p>
            <p>A lot of times you want to give up because you get stuck on a little thing, but you can always try again. Additionally,
                there are many places like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> that help with most if not all of your
                errors.</p>
            <h2>Languages</h2>
            <p>Here are the programming languages I know ranked by level of proficiency:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Java (turned out to be quite useless)</li>
                <li>JavaScript (and HTML + CSS)</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Bash (enough to make simple scripts)</li>
                <li>CPP (currently learning)</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>My projects</h2>
            <p>Surprisingly, I don't have that many impressive or useful projects because I never have ideas, so don't expect to be shocked.</p>
            <h3><a href="/pages/js-graphing">Rudimentary graphing calculator</a></h3>
            <div class="imageContainer">
                <img src="/uploads/graphing_calculator.png" alt="Graphing Calculator"/>
            </div>
            <p>I didn't want to spend too much time on this project because my goal wasn't to make a fully functioning graphing calculator.
                Instead, I basically just made a graphing, without the calculator.</p>
            <p>The hardest part of this project was actually making something that could parse strings into mathematical expressions and
                calculate them. The second-hardest part was making the page look half decent.</p>
            <h3><a href="/pages/files">File hosting via GitHub</a></h3>
            <div class="imageContainer">
                <img src="/uploads/file_browser.png" alt="File Browser"/>
            </div>
            <p>While this might sound stupid at first (and will probably sound more stupid once I explain it), this isn't what you think it
                is.</p>
            <p>One day I opened my <a href="https://getsharex.com/">ShareX</a> screenshots folder, only to see that it had grown to multiple
                gigabytes in size. This was unacceptable for me and I decided I wanted to host my pictures externally. Not wanting to spend
                money, I got the idea to use GitHub to store my images.</p>
            <p>Now, whenever I record something or take a screenshot using ShareX, a python script runs and uploads the image or video to
                GitHub. In order to not have to log in every time I wanted to upload something, I simply set up an SSH key on my computer
                that keeps me logged in at all times.</p>
            <p>For convenience, I created a (badly made) file browser that lets me browse that repository. To access repositories on GitHub
                without going through the website, you need to make a token. Fortunately, you can configure token permissions, so don't even
                try doing anything with it.</p>
