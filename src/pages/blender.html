            <h2>Why Blender?</h2>
            <p>It's fun and I think it's pretty useful to know how to use a 3D software.</p>
            <p>I got started with Blender from <a href="https://youtu.be/nIoXOplUvAw">this video</a> by
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru">Blender Guru.</a></p>
            <h2>My projects</h2>
            <h3>Beginner donut (tutorial)</h3>
            <p>My very first project. I followed the tutorial mentioned above to make this.</p>
            <p>If you play the video on loop, you'll notice the donut loops perfectly. Unfortunately the sprinkles do not.</p>
            <div class="imageContainer">
                <video controls loop>
                    <source src="/uploads/blender_donut.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    <p>Your browser couldn't load the video. Download it <a href="/uploads/blender_donut.mp4">here</a>.</p>
                </video>
            </div>
            <p>If you notice some clipping in the background, that's because the focal length wasn't high enough and the sprinkles were
                too far away, but I didn't notice that before rendering. The animation has a few other minor flaws but I don't think it's worth
                rendering again just to fix them (it took over an hour to render).</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>A simple animation showing cookies falling.</p>
