	<p>
		I've mainly used C++ so far to create simple command line programs, GUI apps with GTK, and to
		learn a bit about rendering with OpenGL. I'd like to say I have some experience with the
		language but it's very complicated and quite old, so I'm basically a beginner compared to some
		other people.
