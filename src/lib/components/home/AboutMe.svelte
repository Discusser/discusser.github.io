	<p>
		I'm a person who enjoys programming, maths, and physics. I also like playing the piano, working
		out, and reading (mainly philosophy books). What I enjoy the most with programming is the fact
		that I can build whatever I want given enough time. At the moment, I'm still in high school, and
		I plan on studying something related to computer science later on. Some of my projects are
		available on the <a href="/projects" class="text-blue-500">Projects</a>
		page, and most of them are on my
		<a href="https://github.com/Discusser" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500">GitHub</a>
		page
